## Dept of Ping

Here we reveal, rank, and applaud the homeservers with the lowest ping, as measured by [pingbot](https://github.com/maubot/echo), a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that you can host on your own server.

### [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net)
Join [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net) to experience the fun live, and to find out how to add YOUR server to the game.

## That's all I know
